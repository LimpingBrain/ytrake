# ytrake

GUI tool to embed metadata for albums on video streaming sites supported by `youtube-dlp`.
Requires youtube-dlp

Used youtube dlp instead of dl, changed program to use youtube channels information as metadata instead of entered data. I use this to download audio books that are created by youtubers. It will save the files in chosen directory under Youtubers name, then the playlist name. It also assigns track numbers based on file postion in playlist and artist, album artist as the youtuber. The album is the playlist name. SHould work for downloading your favourite youtube singers as well

This project does not promote the downloading of copyrighted content, and I urge you to adhere to the usage policies for each site you wish to use this tool with.
